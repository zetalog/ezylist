<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
The last thing you need to do is create the .forward file on your server.  The .forward file is used by Sendmail, 
and will redirect all unrouted e-mail to the auto responder script.  

<br><br>

First, you have to make sure all unrouted e-mail is going to your home directory.  You currently have a system e-mail account, which is 
usually located at <i>username@domain.com</i>.  For example, if you own the domain <i>joesmith.com</i>, your system mailbox is probably 
<i>joesmith@joesmith.com</i>.  You MUST make sure all unrouted e-mail is being sent to your system mailbox.  If your web host offers dump e-mail 
accounts, or allows you to specify a default e-mail address, please make sure this is set to your system mailbox.  If it is not, the auto responders 
will not work.

<br><br>

Once you have made sure all unrouted e-mail is being delivered to your system mailbox, you need to create your .forward file.  To do this, please follow 
these steps:

<br><blockquote><ol>
	<li>Telnet into your server.
	<li>Stay in the directory you first enter.  Do NOT change directories.
	<li>Determine the full path to the <i>process.pl</i> script on your server.  This is in 
		your /cgi-bin/ directory when you uploaded the script.
	<li>At the prompt, type <tt>echo "|/full/path/to/process.pl" &gt; .forward</tt>
	<li>Of course, replace <tt>/full/path/to/process.pl</tt> with the full path to the process.pl script on your server.  
		Make sure you leave the | mark at the beginning.
	<li>Next, just chmod the .forward file to 755		
</ol></blockquote><br>

Your .forward file should now be successfully created.  All auto responder functions should now work perfectly on your 
server.
