<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
This section contains step by step instructions on how to install the eZyList Pro on 
your web server.  The installation process has been made much easier for version 2.0.  In order to 
install the eZyList Pro, you must know how to use the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li><a href="tutorials/ftp/index.html">File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</a>
	<li><a href="tutorials/telnet/index.html">Basic Telnet</a>
</ul><br>

We urge you to take your time with the installation and not to try and rush through it.  If you try and 
rush through it, there is a good chance you will make a mistake, and it will take you even longer to try and 
fix it.  So please, take your time and read the instructions very carefully.
