<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
The first thing you need to do is make sure the location of Perl on your server in every script 
is correct.  Right now, the location to Perl in all scripts is set to <b>/usr/bin/perl</b>.  If the 
location to Perl on your server is the same, you can go ahead and proceed to the next step of the 
installation procedure.

<br><br>

If you do not know the location of Perl on your server, follow these steps to find out:
<br><ol>
	<li>Telnet into your server.
	<li>At the telnet prompt, type <b>which perl</b>.  The location of Perl 
	should be printed to the screen.
	<li>If that didn't print anything, type <b>whereis perl</b>.  The location of Perl
	should be printed to the screen.
	<li>If that didn't print anything, please contact your server administrator and ask for the 
	location of Perl on your server.
</ol>

However, if the location of Perl on your server is different, you must open up the following files
in a text editor like Notepad, and change the very first line to the location of Perl on your server.  
When doing this, make sure you leave the <b>#!</b> at the beginning of the first line.  Here's a list 
of the files you will need to change:
<br><ul>
	<li>cgi-bin/error.cgi
	<li>cgi-bin/followup.pl
	<li>cgi-bin/install.cgi
	<li>cgi-bin/newuser.cgi
	<li>cgi-bin/process.pl
	<li>cgi-bin/reminder.cgi
	<li>cgi-bin/subscribe.cgi
	<li>cgi-bin/update.pl
	<li>cgi-bin/admin/admin.cgi
	<li>cgi-bin/cpanel/index.cgi
</ul><br>

To continue with the installation, please click on the <i>Next</i> button below.
