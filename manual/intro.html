<font face="arial" size=3><b>Introduction</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
The eZyList Pro is a very specialized mailing list system.  You, and your members, can create several different e-mail 
messages, which are automatically sent out to the subscribers of your mailing list at different time intervals.  The script also allows you to create 
and assign an auto responder to a mailing list, so when someone sends an e-mail to the auto responder, they are automatically added to the 
mailing list, and follow ups begin.

<br><br>

By owning the eZyList Pro, you will have access to the Admin Control Panel, which allows you to easily manage a large 
database of members, giving each of them access to their own Control Panel, from where they can create and manage their mailing lists and auto 
responders.

<br><br>

Tons of features are included with this powerful script such as, multiple mailing lists, multiple auto responders, 
automatic removal of undeliverable messages, personalized follow up messages, ability to schedule one-time mailings, 
superior logging features, plus much more.

<br><br>

We would like to thank you for purchasing the eZyList Pro from eZyScripts.Com.  We hope you are 
very happy with your purchase, and find this script very useful.
