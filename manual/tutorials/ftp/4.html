<font face="arial" size=3><b>FTP Tutorial - Renaming and Deleting, Files and Directories</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
To rename or delete a file or directory, first select the file or directory you wish to rename or delete.  To
delete what you have selected, all you do is hit the Delete key on your keyboard.  This will bring up a small confirmation 
box asking you if you are sure you want to delete it.  Hit the OK button, and CuteFTP will delete the file or directory.

<br><br>

Instead, if you would like to rename the file or directory, either click on the
<img src="../../images/ftp_button_rename.gif" width=21 height=20 border=0> 
button in your toolbar, or go to the menu Commands->Rename.  This will bring up a small
dialog box.  Change the name of the file or directory to whatever you want, and click on the OK
button in the dialog box.
