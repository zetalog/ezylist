<font face="arial" size=3><b>FTP Tutorial - Transfer Mode</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
There's one other thing you need to know before you can start uploading CGI scripts to your server.  
You MUST upload all CGI scripts in ASCII format.  To do this, before you upload your CGI scripts, 
go to the menu FTP->Transfer Type->ASCII.  This will make CuteFTP upload everything in ASCII format.
	
<br><br>

There's a little trick you can do so you will not have to worry about switching over to ASCII mode every time.  
go to the menu FTP->Settings->Text-files extensions.  This will bring up a small dialog box which looks like this: 
	
<br><blockquote>
<img src="../../images/ftp_dialog_ascii.gif" width=221 height=217 border=0>
</blockquote><br>

Click on the ADD button, and type <tt>CGI</tt> in the text box at the top.  Then push the ADD button again, and type <tt>PL</tt> at the top.  
Keep doing this until you have all of the following extensions added in.  <tt>CGI, PL, MSG, CONF, DAT, LOG, REP</tt>.  From now on, anything 
you upload to your server which has one of those extensions, will be automatically uploaded in ASCII format, so you no 
longer have to worry about manually changing it every time!
	
<br><br>
	
Well, that's about it for the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) tutorial.  You should now know everything you need to, in order to manage and maintain 
your web server using FTP.
