<font face="arial" size=3><b>FTP Tutorial - Transferring Files</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
Now that you know how to move around your web server from directory to directory, let's find out how to 
transfer files to and from your web server.  Look in the toolbar for the two buttons that look like 
<img src="../../images/ftp_button_transfer.gif" width=50 height=18 border=0>.  These are called the 
Upload and Download buttons, which are used to transfer files.
	
<br><br>
	
Of course, the button with the up arrow will upload a file to your web server from your computer, and the button
with the down arrow will download a file from your web server onto your computer.

<br><br>

To upload a file to your web server, first, select which file on your computer you would like to upload using the
left hand side part of the window.  Once you have selected a file, click on the Upload Button (the one with the up arrow).
A few messages should scroll past in the top window, and CuteFTP will refresh the right hand side of your screen.
	
<br><br>
	
Take a look at the files on your web server now.  Well what do you know, the file you just uploaded is sitting there!  Downloading a file 
from your web server, to your computer is done in the exact same way.  First, select the file you would like to download, then click 
on the Download button, and CuteFTP will place that file on your computer!
