<font face="arial" size=3><b>Telnet Tutorial - Introduction</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
This tutorial will teach you the basics of using Telnet, which allows you to communicate with your web server in a 
different, and more effective, way than File Transfer Protocol (FTP).  For this tutorial, we will be using the telnet 
client, CRT 2.3.  If you do not already have this program, you may download the shareware version for free by 
<a href="http://www.vandyke.com/download/crt/index.html">clicking here</a>.
	
<br><br>
	
You should now have CRT 2.3 downloaded and installed on your computer.  OK, launch the CRT program, and you should 
see a screen which looks like this:
	
<br><br>
<center><img src="../../images/telnet_main.gif" width=350 height=249 border=0></center><br>
<br>
	
Let's start by connecting to your web server.  To connect to your web server, click on the 
"Quick Connect" button which is the second from the left in the toolbar.  This will bring up a dialog box which looks like this:

<br><br>
<center><img src="../../images/telnet_dialog_connect.gif" width=270 height=221 border=0></center>
<br><br>
	
Enter your ip address, or your domain name in the box which says "Hostname or IP", and click on the OK button at the bottom of 
the dialog box.  Wait a few seconds for a connection with your web server to be established.  The screen should display a few words, 
and ask for your login.  Type in the username you use for your web server, and hit enter.  Next, it will ask for your password.  Type in 
your password, and hit enter again.  Don't worry, the screen isn't supposed to display anything when your typing your password in.

<br><br>

If you entered your username and password correctly, something should have appeared on your screen saying you have successfully logged in.  Here's 
what my screen shows once I login:

That's about all there is to logging into your web server with telnet.
