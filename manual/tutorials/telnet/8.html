<font face="arial" size=3><b>Telnet Tutorial - The <tt>pico</tt> Editor</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
After a while, you will realize it's very annoying when you have to reupload an entire file to your server when you only edit a couple 
characters.  There's a great program which most, but not all, UNIX servers have called <tt>pico</tt>.  Pico is sort of like Notepad on
Microsoft Windows, but instead it's for UNIX.  The pico editor lets you easily edit files on your web server without having to make the 
changes on your computer, then reupload the entire file.  To open a file with pico, you would type:

<br><blockquote><tt>
pico FILENAME<br>
pico script.cgi
</tt></blockquote><br>

The above example will open up the file <tt>script.cgi</tt> in the pico editor.  The pico editor will display the contents of the file, and 
show a cursor which you may move around by using the arrow keys.  Remember, this is basically like Notepad for Microsoft Windows.  You can 
go ahead and start typing in new text, and deleting text.

<br><br>

There are a couple simple things you should know about the pico editor.  First, to move down to the next page, you have to push <tt>Ctrl+X</tt> and to 
move up a page you have to push <tt>Ctrl+Y</tt>.  Once you have completed editing the file, and want to save and exit, push <tt>Ctrl+X</tt>.  This will ask 
you if you would like to save your changes or not.  Press <tt>Y</tt> if you would like to, and <tt>N</tt> if you don't want to.  If you do press <tt>Y</tt> and 
save your changes, it will ask the filename you would like to save to.  If you would like to save the changes to the file itself, just hit enter, but if you would 
like to save the changes to a new file, and keep the old file, type in a new filename and hit enter.
