<font face="arial" size=3><b>Telnet Tutorial - Debugging CGI Scripts</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
Don't you hate it when you try to run a CGI script and you get a big ugly "500 Internal Server Error?"  Here's a little trick which will help 
you find out what's wrong with the CGI script.  All you have to do, it telnet into your account, change directories to the directory your CGI script is 
in, and type <tt>./script.cgi</tt>.  The <tt>./</tt> means run this program, and <tt>script.cgi</tt> tells the server which program to run.

<br><br>

Your server will then try to run the CGI script.  If anything goes wrong, it will give off an explanation of the error which occurred.  It will print out an
error on your telnet screen, like <tt>Permission Denied</tt>, which means you have to chmod that file to 755.
