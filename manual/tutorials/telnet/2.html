<font face="arial" size=3><b>Telnet Tutorial - The <tt>pwd</tt> Command</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
When installing a lot of CGI scripts, you are required to enter the full path on your server to a specified file 
or directory.  This is what the UNIX <tt>pwd</tt> command is for.  To find the full path on your server to a directory, 
first, change to the directory you wish to find the full path of by using the <tt>cd DIRNAME</tt> command.
	
<br><br>
	
Once your inside the directory you want to find the full path of, type <tt>pwd</tt> at the telnet prompt.  This will display the full path 
on your server to the directory you are currently in.  Here's what my screen looks like:
	
<blockquote><tt><pre>
bash-2.01$ cd html
bash-2.01$ pwd
/usr/www/promotio/html
bash-2.01$ 
</pre></tt></blockquote>
	
In this example, the full path to the directory I am currently in is <tt>/usr/www/promotio/html</tt>.  
By using the <tt>pwd</tt> command you can find the full path to any directory on your server.
