<font face="arial" size=3><b>Telnet Tutorial - Viewing the Contents of a File</b></font><br><br>

<blockquote><font face="arial" size=2>
In telnet, there is a very easy way to view the contents of a file on your web server.  This is called the
<tt>cat</tt> command.  To use the <tt>cat</tt> command, at the telnet prompt type:

<br><blockquote><tt>
cat FILENAME<br>
cat script.cgi
</tt></blockquote><br>

This will display, on the telnet screen, the contents of <tt>FILENAME</tt>.  Unfortunately, some files are a little too 
large for this, or what happens if you only want to see the first 30 lines of the file?  There's another UNIX command called 
<tt>head</tt> which will only print out the specified number of lines starting at the beginning of the file.  The basic syntax 
for the <tt>head</tt> command is:

<br><blockquote><tt>
head -n FILENAME<br>
head -30 script.cgi
</tt></blockquote><br>

This will display the first <tt>n</tt> lines of the file <tt>FILENAME</tt>.  If <tt>-n</tt> is left out, 
only the first 20 lines will be displayed.  Now what happens if you want to view only the bottom 20 lines of 
a file?  Once again, there's a UNIX command which will do this for you.  It's called the <tt>tail</tt> command.  
The basic syntax of the <tt>tail</tt> command is:

<br><blockquote><tt>
tail -n FILENAME<br>
tail -20 script.cgi
</tt></blockquote><br>

This will display the last <tt>n</tt> lines of the file <tt>FILENAME</tt>.  If <tt>-n</tt> is omitted, only the 
last 15 lines will be displayed.
</font></blockquote><br>
